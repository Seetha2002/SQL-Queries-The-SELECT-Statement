BETWEEN:
The SQL BETWEEN condition allows you to easily test if an expression is within a range of values (inclusive). The values can be text, date, or numbers. 
It can be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. The SQL BETWEEN Condition will return the records where expression is within the range of 
value1 and value2. 

Syntax: 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

Example:
select * from emp 
where sal between 1000 and 2000;

select * from emp
where ename between 'ALLEN' and 'MILLER';

select ename, empno
from emp
where sal
not between 30000 and 45000;

IN:
IN operator allows you to easily test if the expression matches any value in the list of values. It is used to remove the need of multiple OR condition in SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. You can also use NOT IN to exclude the rows in your list. We should note that any kind of duplicate entry will be retained. 

Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (list_of_values);

Example:
select ename, empno
from emo
where sal IN (1000,2000);

select ename, empno
from emp
where sal NOT IN (500, 1000);
