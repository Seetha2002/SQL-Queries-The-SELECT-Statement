A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. 
Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

Example:
SELECT ename, empno, sal
FROM emp
WHERE comm IS NULL;

SELECT ename, empno, sal
FROM emp
WHERE comm IS NOT NULL;
